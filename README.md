# Talha Mahmood . Jarvis Consulting

Hi there! I am a York University alumni with a BSc Honours Degree in Computer Science. 
I am passionate and dedicate my unwavering commitment to whatever I set my mind to. 
As a result, I have been able to sharpen my work ethic to reflect the person that I am. 
I am a hard working, reliable, and trustworthy individual who is trying to improve every single day. 
Outside of work, I enjoy playing basketball with my team in our local Ahmadiyya Basketball League (ABL). 
I also had the pleasure of serving as President of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Students' Association (AMSA) at York University during my third and fourth years after I was elected by over 200 members. 
Now as an alumni, I continue to remain involved in our local community. Currently I am working and building upon my skills and experience with Jarvis as a Data Engineer Associate so I can continue to learn and grow within the Software industry.

A project that consists of a Linux Server Cluster Monitoring Tool which monitors the cluster resources and sends them to a PSQL database that runs in a docker container.

It does this by utilizing the Twitter REST API and sending GET and POST HTTP requests.

- **[SpringBoot App](./springboot)**: An online stock trading simulation REST API, built with the Springboot framework and utilizes MVC and Microservice design architectures. Stock market data is acquired by making HTTP calls on IEX Cloud's API and the application's data is stored in a PSQL database.

- **[Hadoop](./hadoop)**: Processed big data and built a big data platform utilizing Apache Hadoop and its components including HDFS, MapReduce, and Yarn. I provisioned a Hadoop Cluster on Google Cloud Platform (1 master node and 2 worker nodes) and then solved business problems using Apache Hive and Zepellin Notebook. 

- **[Spark/Scala](./spark)**:  The purpose of this project was to continue working with and processing big data, but this time using Scala and Apache Spark. I worked on various business problems with different datasets using Spark Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDD) and Structured APIs.

- **[Cloud & DevOps](./cloud_devops)**: Deployed the Springboot trading app on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud making it scalable, elastic and highly available. The cloud services that I used are AWS's Elastic Cloud Compute, Amazon Relational Database Service, and AWS's Elastic Beanstalk. Also built a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins to automate and fasten the deployment life cycle.
